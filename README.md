Sakanax is a CLI tool for identifying files that are up in Github PullRequest. For example, specifying a commit ID specifies a PullRequest including the commit ID, and also acquires a list of files included in the PullRequest.


## Usage

First, Specify Github's access token and repository name as an environment variable.

```bash
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=<personal access token>
$ export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=<your repository name>
```

```bash
$ sakanax help
Commands:
  sakanax diff_files --sha=SHA     # Detect files included in the PullRequests containing the target commit ID (sha).
  sakanax help [COMMAND]           # Describe available commands or one specific command
  sakanax pull_requests --sha=SHA  # A list of PullRequests containing the target commit ID (sha).
```

### pull_requests
A list of PullRequests containing the target commit ID (sha).
```bash
$ sakanax pull_requests --sha 536ad1c5c6e5a675122eb0fdcb4ac5da06def098
[3, 2, 1]
```

### diff_files
Detect files included in the PullRequests containing the target commit ID (sha).
```bash
$ sakanax diff_files --sha c5c6e5a6756def0986ad1122eb0a0fdcb4ac5d53
"PullRequest: 32, diff files: ['diff file1', 'diff file2', ...]"
```
